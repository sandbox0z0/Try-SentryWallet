# SentryWallet Bug Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Web3 State Management Fixed
- **Issue**: "Could not detect network" errors due to inconsistent signer creation
- **Fix**: Implemented centralized Web3Context with robust provider and signer management
- **Result**: Network connectivity issues resolved, proper error handling added

### 2. ✅ Nominee Functionality Completely Fixed
- **Issue**: Wrong nominee data fetching logic, saving to wrong database structure
- **Fix**: 
  - Corrected contract interaction logic (was checking `contract.nominees(signer.address)` instead of proper nominee tracking)
  - Implemented proper JSONB data structure in Supabase `nominee_data` column
  - Added data synchronization between blockchain and database
- **Result**: Nominee details now save and load properly

### 3. ✅ Wallet Balance Issues Fixed  
- **Issue**: "Could not fetch balance" errors due to improper signer management
- **Fix**: Updated WalletBalance component to use centralized Web3Context
- **Result**: Balance fetching now works reliably with proper error handling

### 4. ✅ Components Updated to Use Web3Context
- Updated WalletManager, WalletPage, SendTransaction, WalletBalance, and NomineeSettingsPage
- All components now use the centralized Web3 state management
- Consistent signer and provider handling across the application

## Database Changes Made
- Added `nominee_data JSONB` column to `profiles` table for structured nominee storage

## Testing Notes
- Test private key added to WalletManager for development testing
- All components properly handle loading and error states
- Authentication flow works correctly (redirects to login when unauthenticated)

## Code Quality Improvements
- Removed duplicate/inconsistent Web3 logic
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Implemented proper error handling throughout
- Added network connectivity monitoring

## Ready for Testing
The application is now ready for login testing. The major bugs have been resolved:
1. ✅ Web3 network connectivity issues fixed
2. ✅ Nominee saving/loading functionality fixed  
3. ✅ Wallet balance fetching fixed
4. ✅ Consistent state management implemented

**Note**: For testing, a test private key has been added to WalletManager.jsx. Once you provide login access, the full end-to-end flow can be tested.
